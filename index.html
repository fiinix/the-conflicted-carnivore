                    thinly slice the apple and bake the rings in the oven at a

                <dt>Apricot</dt>
                <dd><p>Apricots can be eaten fresh or dried - both are packed
                    with vitamins! Fresh apricots have a soft and slightly furry
                    skin. They make a good lunchbox snack. Apricots are also
                    high in beta-carotene - this helps us keep our eyes and skin
                    healthy.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Asparagus</dt>
                <dd>Asparagus is a shoot vegetable &ndash; we eat the stalk and
                    the tip. It makes any dish look more interesting with its
                    unusual shape. Asparagus is a good source of a vitamin
                    called folate, which is important for healthy blood.
                </dd>
                <dt>Aubergine</dt>
                <dd>Most aubergines are teardrop-shaped and have a glossy purple
                    skin. On the inside, they are spongy and creamy white.
                    Aubergines grow on bushes and are really fruits - although
                    you wouldn't want to eat them raw. Australians and Americans
                    call it eggplant because some types look a bit like large
                    eggs!
                </dd>
                <dt>Avocado</dt>
                <dd><p>It is sometimes called an avocado pear. Avocado is often
                    mistaken for a vegetable because we eat it like a salad
                    vegetable, but it is actually a fruit. Avocados are at their
                    best when they are ripe and very easy to prepare. They can
                    simply be cut in half with the stone removed and eaten with
                    a little salad dressing or chopped into a salad. Avocados
                    are a good source of essential fats (the good ones) - one of
                    the few fruits or vegetables that contain fat.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt><a name="B"></a>Banana</dt>
                <dd><p>Bananas make a nutritious snack! They are a great source
                    of energy and contain lots of vitamins and minerals,
                    especially potassium, which is important to help cells,
                    nerves and muscles in your body to work properly and it
                    helps to lower blood pressure. They have a thick skin to
                    protect them, which is green before bananas are ripe, and
                    get more yellow in colour and sweeter in taste as they
                    ripen. We peel away the skin and eat the soft fleshy part of
                    the fruit underneath. Bananas grow in hanging clusters,
                    sometimes called hands, on the banana plant in tropical
                    regions like Southeast Asia. You can eat them raw, baked,
                    dried or in a smoothie. Why don't you try mashing it up and
                    have it with yoghurt or porridge or even on brown toast?</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Beetroot</dt>
                <dd><p>Beetroot is the root of the beet plant - which explains
                    its name! People have grown it for food since Roman times.
                    Raw beetroot is best for you and great for grating - peel it
                    first. Try it in a salad or sandwich. Small beetroots are
                    usually the sweetest. Ahhhh!</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Black-eye bean</dt>
                <dd><p>In America, these beans are often called black-eyed peas
                    or cow peas. They each have a little black dot on the side -
                    this is where they were once attached to their pod, so it's
                    a bit like a belly button! You can mix them with all sorts
                    of other beans to make a super salad.</p>

                <dt>Broad bean</dt>
                <dd><p>Another name for this bean is the ‘Fava bean’. Broad
                    beans grow in a green, leathery pod. The beans can be eaten
                    fresh, when they are green, or dried, when they have turned
                    brown. The way to identify them is by their flat, broad
                    shape. Beans are a good source of protein and fibre.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Broccoli</dt>
                <dd>Broccoli is closely related to cabbage - and it's another
                    one of those 'greens' we're always being told to eat up. The
                    part of a broccoli plant we normally eat is the lovely
                    flowerhead - the flowers are usually green but sometimes
                    purple. Steamed broccoli is tasty in a salad or stir-fry.
                </dd>
                <dt>Brussels sprout</dt>
                <dd>Brussels sprouts are like mini cabbages! They grow out of
                    the ground in knobbly rows on a long tough stalk. They
                    contain loads of vitamin C. Can you guess which country
                    BRUSSELS sprouts originally came from? Well, Brussels is the
                    capital city of Belgium!
                </dd>
                <dt>Butternut Squash</dt>
                <dd><p>Butternut squash is large and pear-shaped with a
                    golden-brown to yellow skin. We don't eat the skin and
                    seeds, only the flesh. The flesh is really hard when it is
                    raw but it turns soft and sweet when it is cooked. It can be
                    roasted, pureed, mashed or used in soups or casseroles. It
                    is a good source of beta-carotene, which is turned into
                    vitamin A in the body. Beta-carotene gives the flesh its
                    bright orange colour.</p>

                <dd><p>Carrots grow underground and they can be used in all
                    sorts of dishes - from casseroles to cakes. Raw carrots are
                    great to crunch on and they make a healthy juice, too. They
                    contain lots of beta-carotene - this helps us keep our eyes
                    and skin healthy.</p>

                <dt>Cherry</dt>
                <dd>Cherries are stone fruits - just like their friends the
                    apricots. A cherry tree can carry on producing fruit for 100
                    years! Cherries grow from stalks in pairs. Ahhh! Sweet ones
                    like the Bing cherry are nicest on their own or in a fruit
                    salad. Sour ones like Morello cherries are tastier cooked.
                </dd>
                <dt>Clementine</dt>
                <dd><p>This citrus fruit is the smallest of the tangerines. The
                    skin of Clementines can be peeled away easily and the
                    segments don’t contain pips, which makes them a lot less
                    messy to eat than some other varieties. They smell so
                    delicious and naturally sweet. They are often eaten at
                    Christmas time. Citrus fruits are a good source of vitamin
                    C.</p>

                <dt>Courgette</dt>
                <dd><p>A courgette is a type of squash and if it isn't picked
                    early, it grows into a marrow! Courgettes grow on bushes.
                    They look quite like cucumbers and have very soft seeds.
                    They can be cooked with onions, tomatoes, aubergines and
                    peppers to make ratatouille. The American name for a
                    courgette is 'zucchini'.</p>

                    grapes. The grapes are turned into raisins by drying them in
                    the sun. Sultanas are made the same way but with green
                    grapes. Mini boxes of raisins are perfect for packed
                    lunches.</p>

                <dd><p>Rhubarb was used in Asia long before it was first eaten
                    in Britain. People sometimes grew it in their gardens just
                    because it looked nice! It can be mixed with sweeter fruit
                    like apple. Don't eat the leaves, they are poisonous!</p>

                <dd><p>Satsumas, clementines and mandarins are all different
                    names for types of tangerine. They grow on trees and they
                    grow best in warm weather. The juiciest ones are the
                    heaviest ones. See if you can take the peel off in one
                    piece!</p>

                <dd><p>Anyone for tennis? Followed by some strawberries of
                    course! Around 25,000kg of strawberries are eaten at
                    Wimbledon each year. Strawberries are actually members of
                    the rose family. They are the only fruits to have their
                    seeds on the outside - one strawberry can have as many as
                    200.</p>

                    weather is warm. They are famous for appearing in lots of
                    Caribbean recipes! They come in all kinds of knobbly shapes
                    and just like the name suggests, they are sweeter than
                    ordinary potatoes. Try them baked - or boiled and mashed
                    with carrots.</p>

                    vegetable and see if they know the answer (it's a fruit!).
                    The little cherry tomatoes are sweet and tasty in salads or
                    in your lunchbox. Tomatoes are easy to grow in a pot in the
                    garden. Buy some seeds and have a go!</p>

                <dd><p>According to folklore, turnips were used as jack o'
                    lanterns long before pumpkins! The turnip is sometimes
                    muddled up with its bigger relative, the swede. Both are
                    lovely cooked in a stew, or boiled then mashed, or roasted.
                    Raw turnip can be grated into a salad.</p>

                    mandarin! It is about the size of a grapefruit but it tastes
                    a bit sweeter and has a wrinkly skin that peels easily. This
                    funky fruit comes from Jamaica and is also grown in the USA
                    - and it's not that ugly! It can look a bit weird because
                    its yellowy green skin is thick, rough and puffy - and
                    sometimes a bit blotchy!</p>

                    dark red and are grown in England. They are super sweet
                    eaten raw or can be cooked in tarts and crumbles. Plums have
                    a stone inside. Can you think of other fruits that do?</p>

                    these leaves CAN be eaten! They are picked when they are
                    quite young and then cooked slightly to soften them. They
                    are used like a wrapping paper to make little parcels filled
                    with things such as rice or finely chopped vegetables.</p>

                    it will last longer in the fridge if it is kept in a bowl or
                    jar of water. It is tastiest in the three "S"s - salads,
                    sandwiches and soups. Try saying that quickly!</p>

                    They contain lots of water and are really, really
                    refreshing! In China, children love drinking watermelon
                    juice in summer to help them stay cool. The Chinese name for
                    a watermelon is xigua.

                    tree! Yams are a bit like potatoes but their flesh can be
                    white, yellow or even purple. They come from hot countries
                    in the Caribbean and Africa, where people often mash them up
                    and eat them in spicy stews and soups. A yam can grow to be
